## Overview
**Hello viewer:)**

The project you see here is part of a web-course "JavaScript - The Complete Guide 2024" in Udemy.
I developed the App.js file, as the other files were completed in advance.
### Instructions
The game is simple, you are facing a monster. In order to win, you must kill the monster while staying alive.
At each turn you have four operations to choose from, and after each choise there is an affect on the battle (The monster attacks as well).

Enjoy:)
