*Hello viewer:)*
The project you see here is part of a web-course "JavaScript - The Complete Guide 2024" in Udemy.
I developed the App.js file for this game, as the other files were completed in advance.
The game is simple, we are facing a monster and we want to kill him and stay alive.
there are four options to choose from and after each choise there is an affect on battle.
Enjoy:)
